    Content: |
      I'm Tiana, and I'm passionate about Chinese painting,
      especially the beauty of traditional flowers, fish, birds, and animals that inspire me.
      Iâ€™ve studied with various teachers and traveled to China multiple times,
      learning at Chinese universities to deepen my understanding of classical techniques and themes.
      Through each brushstroke, I strive to honor the timeless traditions of Chinese art and share its elegance and harmony with you.
