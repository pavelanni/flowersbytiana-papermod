My name is Tatiana, though I go by Tiana.
As an artist, I've explored many different techniques throughout my journey.
Years ago, I discovered silk painting, which unexpectedly led me to Chinese art.
Fascinated by this new world, I began studying Chinese calligraphy, which then naturally evolved into an interest in Chinese painting.
I've since studied at several art schools in China, immersing myself in traditional Chinese painting techniques and themes.

## My seal

{{< side-image src="my-seal.jpeg" alt="My seal" position="right" >}}
In Chinese art, red stamps—commonly known as seals or "chops"—serve as the artist's signature
and are integral to the artwork's authenticity and aesthetic.
These seals are typically carved into materials like stone or wood
and then pressed into red ink or cinnabar paste to create an imprint on the artwork.

The meaning of my seal is _Snow Pearl_. In Chinese, 雪珍珠.
I got this name from my teacher whose name is _Snow Lotus_ (雪莲).
